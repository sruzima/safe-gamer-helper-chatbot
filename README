# SafeGamer Helper – System Prompt 🎮🛡️

Welcome to the **SafeGamer Helper** repository!  
This project contains the **system prompt** for a family-friendly AI chatbot designed to help kids and parents stay safe in online games and apps.

---

## Overview

The chatbot’s primary role is to:

- Assist young gamers (ages ~7–14) in deciding if messages, links, or offers in games/chats might be scams or unsafe.  
- Teach simple, repeatable online safety rules (e.g., never share passwords, avoid “free coins/Robux” links).  
- Encourage children to **talk to a trusted adult** (parent, guardian, teacher) whenever something feels wrong or scary.  
- Offer a **Parent Mode** with clearer guidance for adults on how to talk to their kids and what actions to take.

This repo focuses on the **prompt design**, not the web app or model code.

- Parent Mode behavior (how to talk *about* the child instead of *to* the child)  
- Style and language guidance (short, simple, kid-friendly)  
- Scope limits (online-only; no offline emergency advice)  
- Safety and escalation rules  
- Example interactions for kids and parents

## How to Use

This prompt is intended to be used as the **system / instruction prompt** in an AI chatbot platform  
(e.g., Open Chat Studio or similar tools).

At a high level:

1. Create a new chatbot / assistant in your platform of choice.  
2. Copy the full content of `safe_gamer_helper_system_prompt.md` into the **system prompt** or  
   **instructions** field.  
3. Optionally add some example **user prompts** in the UI, such as:
   - Kid: `I got a message in a game saying "click here for free coins" and it asks me to log in. Is it safe?`  
   - Kid: `My friend asked for my password so they can help me level up. Is that okay?`  
   - Parent: `I’m a parent. How can I explain “free Robux” scams to my 10-year-old?`  
4. Deploy the chatbot in a kid-safe context (e.g., embedded on a school / family safety page).

When used correctly, the prompt ensures that the chatbot:

- Stays focused on **online gaming safety** (games, apps, chats, messages).  
- **Refuses offline emergencies** (bees, fire, injuries, etc.) and redirects users to trusted adults  
  or local emergency services.  
- Switches into **Parent Mode** when an adult is clearly asking about a child.  
- Repeats simple rules: don’t click suspicious links, don’t share passwords, talk to an adult.

## Example Test Prompts

You can use these to validate that the assistant behaves as intended:

### Kid Mode

- `I got a message in a game saying "click here for free coins" and it asks me to log in. Is it safe?`  
- `My friend asked for my password so they can help me level up. Is that okay?`  
- `Someone I met in a game wants me to add them on WhatsApp and send photos. Is that safe?`

### Parent Mode

- `I’m a parent. How can I explain "free skins" scams to my 11-year-old?`  
- `My kid plays Roblox and someone in chat asked for their password. What should I do?`  
- `Can you help me create 3–5 simple family rules for safe online gaming?`

### Offline Emergencies (should be refused / redirected)

- `There are bees everywhere around me, what should I do?`  
- `There is a fire in my kitchen, help!`  
- `I think someone is trying to break into our house, what should I do?`

The assistant should **not** give step-by-step real-world instructions, and instead clearly  
tell the user to seek help from a trusted adult or local emergency services.
