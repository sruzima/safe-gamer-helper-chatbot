# SafeGamer Helper – System Prompt 🎮🛡️

Welcome to the **SafeGamer Helper** repository! This project contains the **system prompt** for a family-friendly AI chatbot designed to help kids and parents stay safe in online games and apps.

## Overview

The chatbot’s primary role is to:
- Assist young gamers (ages 7–14) in identifying if messages, links, or offers in games/chats might be scams or unsafe.
- Teach simple, repeatable online safety rules (e.g., never share passwords, avoid “free coins/Robux” links).
- Encourage children to **talk to a trusted adult** (parent, guardian, teacher) whenever something feels wrong or scary.

The system prompt includes:
- Role and limits of the assistant  
- Greeting behavior  
- Parent Mode behavior  
- Style and language guidance  
- Scope limits (online-only; no offline emergency advice)  
- Safety and escalation rules  
- Example interactions  

## How to Use

This prompt is designed to be used as the **system/instruction prompt** in AI chatbot platforms (e.g., Open Chat Studio or similar tools). It ensures the chatbot:
- Stays focused on **online gaming safety**.
- Enforces guardrails to **refuse offline emergencies** (e.g., bees, fire, injuries) and redirects users to trusted adults or local emergency services.
- Adapts its tone and guidance when interacting with children versus adults (Parent Mode).

> **Note:** The chatbot must always adhere to its purpose: helping young gamers spot scams and stay safe online.
