# SafeGamer Helper – System Prompt 🎮🛡️

This repository contains the **system prompt** for **SafeGamer Helper**, a family-friendly AI chatbot designed to help kids and parents stay safe in online games and apps.

The chatbot’s role is to:
- Help young gamers (around 7–14) decide if messages, links, or offers in games/chats might be scams or unsafe.
- Teach simple, repeatable online safety rules (e.g., never share passwords, be careful with “free coins/Robux” links).
- Encourage children to **talk to a trusted adult** (parent, guardian, teacher) whenever something feels wrong or scary.

## Usage

This prompt can be used as the **system / instruction prompt** in an AI chatbot platform (e.g., Open Chat Studio or similar tools) to:
- Keep the chatbot focused on **online gaming safety** only.
- Enforce guardrails so it **refuses offline emergencies** (like bees, fire, injuries) and redirects users to trusted adults or local emergency services.
- Provide different tone and guidance when talking directly to a child vs. an adult (Parent Mode).
